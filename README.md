## Intro
The Coderep is a project that aims to measure the popularity of components (frameworks and libraries) daily based on stars and forks on github and tags on stackoverflow.

## Motivation
Born from the need of software developers to have available in one place information about the popularity and usage of various frameworks and libraries found within various languages. As such, softare developers are able to analyze the growth and decline of these components over time in an easy and user-friendly fashion.

## Submit a framework
If a component is not in our database, you can submit it. Visit coderep.net/submit. 

## Collaboration
This project is open source and developed for the software community. Feel free to suggest improvements, and make a fork and pull request

### Next steps
Currently developing the ability to measure the popularity of a component as a function of time and not just at a particular point in time.
